## About this repository
This repository is beginner friendly with designs that will be available for implementation when we will be creating issues - if designs are not available and required then we will create an issue for that as well. 

The goal of this project is to help anyone (of any level) contribute to an open source project during the hacktoberfest.

### Purpose of this project is to implement a playground for developers to practice with Dart and solve Data Structures & Algorithms.

Therefore feel free to contribute if:
1. you are a beginner, mid or senior level Flutter Developer
2. you are a designer
3. you will be documentating the code
4. you will be working on the server side
